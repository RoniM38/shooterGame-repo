This is game is a zombie shooter game. The main objective is to shoot zombies that will appear on the screen.<br>
When you shoot a zombie, it will die and your score will increase.<br>
If you don't shoot a zombie and it touches the bottom of the window, you lose health (you start off with 100% health and 3 lives).<br>
Every time your health reaches 0% or less, you will lose a life and your health will reset to 100% if you have lives left. If you have 0 lives left, the game will end.<br>

Keyboard Shortcuts:<br>
q- quit the game and go back to the main menu.<br>
p- pause the game (you can continue the game by pressing p again or by clicking the "continue" button that will be displayed on the screen).

Enjoy ;)
