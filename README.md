This is game is a zombie shooter game. The main objective is to shoot zombies that will appear on the screen.

Main Menu Description:
When running the game, you will be directed to a main menu. There are two buttons in the menu: a "PLAY" button and a "Rules" button.
When clicking on the rules button, the rules of the game will be displayed on the screen. You can click the blue "X" button on the top left corner of the screen
in order to go back to the main menu. When clicking on the play button, you will be directed to the game.

Game Description:
On the game window, you will be able to view your score, your high score, a health bar displaying your health, the amount of lives you have left and the FPS.
You will start off with 100 health points (a full health bar) and 3 lives.
You will be playing in "first person mode", meaning you can only see your hands and the pistol that you will be using to shoot the zombies with. 
You can shoot a zombie by clicking on it with your mouse. When clicking on a position on the game window with your mouse, a bullet coming from your 
pistol will be shot to that position. If the bullet hits a zombie, the zombie will die and disappear from the screen. Your score will be incremented by 5 points.
If the bullet doesn't hit anything, it will just disappear when it gets to the position of the mouse click. If you don't shoot a zombie and it gets to the ground,
the zombie will disappear and you will lose 5 health points. When your health reaches 0, you will lose one of your lives. If you are left with 0 lives, you will
be directed to a "Game Over" screen (read the game over description for details). The game will get harder as it progresses by decreasing the wait time between
spawning each zombie, increasing the speed of the zombies and increasing the amount of zombies that can appear on the screen simultaneously. The hardest part of the
game is "Extreme Mode". Extreme Mode is enabled before the game becomes impossible, meaning it is very challenging. When you reach Extreme Mode, a "Extreme Mode"
label will be displayed at the top of the window. When quitting the game, your high score will be saved and you will be able to see it when playing again.

Game Over Description:
When losing all of your lives, you will be directed to the "Game Over" screen. This page will inform you that you have lost the game and will play some annoying music.
You can stop the music by clicking on the "Stop" button on the top left corner of the window. There is also a "Menu" button that directs you to the main menu
when clicked.

Keyboard Shortcuts:
q- quit the game and go back to the main menu.
p- pause the game (you can continue the game by pressing p again or by clicking the "continue" button that will be displayed on the screen).

Thanks for reading ;)
